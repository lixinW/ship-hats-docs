# Book a session

Agencies can now request for a one-hour session for the CIO or Business or IT leaders to build the CI/CD strategy. The session will include an overview of Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) and SHIP-HATS roadmap.

[Submit a request](https://form.gov.sg/#!/6086619c7be16c0012b35281) on our enquiry form to schedule. After you submit the form, we will reach out in five business days to schedule a session depending on availability of the leaders from the agency and GovTech.
