# CI/CD Pipeline


As per the DevSecOps policies in IM8, you must plan for the following stages to set up your CI/CD pipeline:

- Stage 1: Planning
- Stage 2: Development (Code)
- Stage 3: Building and Packaging
- Stage 4: Pre-release Testing
- Stage 5: Deployment & Release
- Stage 6: Operations & Monitoring

For practical guidance to incorporate DevSecOps policies in IM8 while configuring CI/CD pipeline, refer to the [DevSecOps Playbook](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/devsecops-playbook/#/).
