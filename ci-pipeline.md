# CI Pipeline

This tutorial guides you to set up a simple pipeline using Javascript to check out and scan the sample application in SHIP-HATS.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Set up CI Pipeline](#set-up-ci-pipeline)

## Prerequisites
- You must have Bitbucket, Bamboo, Nexus IQ, and Nexus Repository added to your project.  If not, please contact your Project Admin to get the required access.
- You must have *write access* to the projects created on the above-mentioned tools. If not, please contact your Project Admin to get the required access.
- You must have a basic understanding of the SHIP-HATS CI Tools (Bitbucket, Bamboo, Nexus IQ, and Nexus Repository).

## Set up CI Pipeline

### To set up a simple pipeline to check out and scan the sample application in SHIP-HATS:

1. **Fork Repo to Bitbucket**  

    Bitbucket is a source code management tool. Source code for your application is hosted within a Bitbucket repository. A Bitbucket project contains one or more repositories.  

    Normally, an application development team will create an empty repository and check in their code. For this tutorial, we will make use of existing code. We will create a new repository by forking from another repository.

1. **Integrate Bitbucket to Bamboo** 

    As your code repo is in Bitbucket, we need to integrate it into Bamboo to allow and automate testing of the code/application. Bamboo is essentially a build tool that allows constant merging, testing of code  which allows  development teams to receive rapid feedback on their work.

1. **Add a Bamboo Trigger**  

    Adding a Bamboo Trigger is required so that Bamboo is notified whenever there is a code change in any of the selected source code repositories.

1. **Add Bamboo Tasks**  

    Adding Bamboo tasks allows the automated execution of code, steps and processes.

1. **Add Nexus IQ**  

    Adding Nexus IQ as a Bamboo task allows the execution of vulnerability scanning for dependencies and libraries.
