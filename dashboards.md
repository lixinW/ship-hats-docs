# Dashboards

In SHIP-HATS 2.0., we are leveraging the [GitLab dashboards]() available within the [GitLab Ultimate Tier](). These dashboards will be able to showcase the following key metrics:  

- **DevOps Adoption:** Whether a project is utilizing end-to-end CI/CD components à only shows GitLab-Native Adoption
- **DORA Metrics:** Industry benchmarks on DevOps Process Efficiency
    - Deployment Freq
    - Lead time for Changes
    - Time to Restore Service
    - Change Failure Rate
- **Security Dashboard:** monitor security findings and patterns à does not show SonarQube and Nexus IQ
- **Value Stream Analytics:** triage hygiene, issues / bugs created, time to merge and many more enable you to identify and fix inefficiencies in your development process à does not show Jira/Confluence issues

The above listed data and metrics can only be pulled out from the use of GitLab-native Tools. Therefore, to utilize the benefits of these Dashboards, agencies must adopt as many GitLab-native tools as possible.
