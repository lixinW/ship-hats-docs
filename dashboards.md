# Dashboards

In SHIP-HATS 2.0., we are leveraging the *GitLab dashboards* available within the *GitLab Ultimate Tier*. These dashboards will be able to showcase the following key metrics for GitLab native tools:  

- **DevOps Adoption:** View how a project is utilizing end-to-end CI/CD components. <!--This dashboard will show GitLab native adoption only.-->
- **DORA Metrics:** View Industry benchmarks on DevOps process efficiency. You can measure the following four DORA metrics:
    - Deployment Freq
    - Lead time for Changes
    - Time to Restore Service
    - Change Failure Rate
- **Security Dashboard:** Monitor security findings and patterns across GitLab native tools. <!--This dashboard does not show data for SonarQube and Nexus IQ-->
- **Value Stream Analytics:** Triage hygiene, issues/bugs created, time to merge, etc. This dashboard enables you to identify and fix inefficiencies in your development process. <!--This dashboard does not show data for Jira/Confluence issues-->

The above listed data and metrics can only be retrieved from the use of GitLab native tools. Therefore, to utilize the benefits of these Dashboards, agencies must adopt as many GitLab native tools as possible.

## Developer dashboards

Following developer dashboards are available:

- [Environments dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/environments_dashboard.html) 
- [Operations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/operations_dashboard/)
- [Security](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) 

To access these dashboards, select **Main menu**, and then choose the dashboard (Environments/Operations/Security) that you want to view under **Your dashboards**. However, you must configure the dashboards as described in GitLab documentation to view meaningful response.
