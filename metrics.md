## DevSecOps Maturity Report (Beta)

You can now use the `.generate-maturity-report` template to generate a [report](https://sgts.gitlab-dedicated.com/wog/gvt/ship/ship-hats-templates/-/tree/main/templates#file-gitlab-ci-generate-maturity-reportyml) to measure DevSecOps maturity from users' CI/CD pipelines for a project's default branch. The report is generated as an HTML job artefact for viewing. 

In addition, we are looking for agencies to be part of this pilot to review features of the report. To take part in pilot, please [reach out to us](https://go.gov.sg/she) to be part of the pilot.
