# Metrics

## DevSecOps Beta Report Tool

You can now use the `.generate-maturity-report` template to generate [Maturity report](https://sgts.gitlab-dedicated.com/wog/gvt/ship/ship-hats-templates/-/tree/main/templates#file-gitlab-ci-generate-maturity-reportyml) to measure DevSecOps maturity from users' CI/CD pipelines for a project's default branch. The report is generated as an HTML job artefact for viewing.
