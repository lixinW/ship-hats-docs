# Pipeline templates

SHIP-HATS Pipeline templates are reusable configuration files that developers can use to configure instead of building from the scratch. The templates help agencies to incorporate best practices for security compliance and performance metrics.

## List of Templates  

This section provides a high level of overview of templates to expect for migrating to SHIP-HATS 2.0 to help the agencies plan the migration.

We will update the link to templates after SHIP-HATS 2.0 is ready. You can bookmark this page as we will update details on existing and upcoming templates regularly.
