## What you can do now

1.	**Identify 1st system to migrate Plan:** Evaluate your systems on SHIP-HATS and identify a system based on [System for Early Migration](ship-hats-migration-annex#systems-for-early-migration) recommendations.
2.	**Plan timeline:** Based on the high-level [migration approach](ship-hats-migration), identify the best suited time for migration.
3.	**Heads up stakeholders:** Prepare your stakeholders on the upcoming migration and possible budget approvals to support the effort. 
4.	**Let us know:** If you have dependencies that are time sensitive, [log a ticket](http://go.gov.sg/she) with description of the systems, the time constraints, and information that you require. We will engage on a case-by-case basis for urgent requirements.
