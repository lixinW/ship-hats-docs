<!--This document provides information for migrating from SHIP-HATS version 1.0 to SHIP-HATS version 2.0 
This is a guide for SHIP-HATS users to plan the migration of their systems from SHIP-HATS version 1.0 to SHIP-HATS version 2.0. The guide includes details for Subscription Administrators (SA), Project Administrators (PA), and Developers (Users) to plan for the internal approvals and processes, reviewing any contract details with outsourced vendors, and technical planning.
