## Staggered Migration
 
We want our users to have minimal disruptions. We will fine tune the migration steps during pilots. We will open appointment slots for migration planning in Q2 and SHIP-HATS 2.0 will be open for all from November. 

In Q3' FY22, we will be inviting Agencies to start migration. For more information on how to choose projects for migration, refer to [System for Early Migration](ship-hats-migration-annex#systems-for-early-migration) in the Annex section.
