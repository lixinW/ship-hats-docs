## Book Migration Slots

### What is a Migration slot?

These are 6, 9, or 12-week long windows available for Agency to complete their migration.

### How it works
1. Each subscriber book one slot based on when they want to migrate by 31 December 2022. We recommend moving all projects in the same slot.
1. Choose a support option:
