        - Expected date to off-board

        - PrismaCloud app name
        - Text box to capture Sonatype app name
        - Master billing crowd/ldap group name  

    You will receive an email confirmation with further details. 

**After you have raised the service request for off-boarding:**
- When SA or PA logs in to the SHIP-HATS portal, in the **Alerts** section, you will see a termination message.
- Tools cannot be added
- Changing the PA function is disabled. 
- User invitations are disabled. 
- After the termination date, SA or PA will not be able to view the subscription details for the off-boarded account. However, if SA or PA have other subscription accounts, theu will continue to view details for these additional subscriptions accounts.
