## [Create new projects](#create-new-projects)

Subscription Admin (SA) can create new projects in SHIP-HATS and manage them. SAs assign Project Admins (PA). Both SA and PA can manage the projects by adding project tools and add users.

### To create a new project:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **Create New**.  

>**Tip:** Alternatively, if you are viewing **All Projects**, click **Create Project**.

    - **Project Description**: Specify details of the project. 
    - **Project Admin 1:** Select Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
    - **Project Admin 2:** This is an optional field. Select a second Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list. 
3. Click **Create Project**. The created project details are displayed as shown below.

    <kbd>![newly-created-project](newly-created-project.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

SA or PA can add tools and additional PAs. 
> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.

## [View projects](#view-projects)

SA and PAs of a subscription account can view all the projects of the subscription account.

## [Add project admins](#add-project-admins)

Subscription Admins can add Project Admins using the SHIP-HATS portal. When creating a project in an account, it is mandatory to specify at least one Project Admin. SAs can add any additional PAs anytime in the future.  

> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.

### To add a project admin:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to Switch account.
2. Locate the project and click **Manage**.

    <kbd>![add-pa-1-resized](add-pa-1-resized.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

3. Click the edit icon. **Manage Admin** panel is displayed.

    <kbd>![add-pa-2-resized](add-pa-2-resized.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

4. Click **Add another** to select the required user from the drop-down list.

    <kbd>![add-pa-3-correct](add-pa-3-correct-resized.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

    >**Note:** If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
5. Click **Add** to add this user as a project admin. Once successfully added, an email notification will be sent to the requesting SA with copy sent to the other SA and the newly added PA.

>**Note:** To know how to remove a Project Admin, refer to **Remove User**.

## [Add project tools](#add-project-tools)

SA or PA can add the required project tools as explained below. You can add tools for Development, Build, QA &amp; Security and Release phases as per the tools quota allotted for your subscription type. Note that currently you need to raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) for adding the following:

- Build tool - Nexus IQ and Nexus Repo
- Release and Deploy tool- Digital.ai Release and Digital.ai Deploy

> **Note:** SA and PA must have logged in to SonarQube at least once before proceeding to create applications in SonarQube.


### To add project tools:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to Switch account.
2. Locate the project and click **Manage**.

    <kbd>![add-new-development-tool](add-new-development-tool.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

3. Go to the required tab and click **Add tool**.
4. For example, go to **Development** tab and click **Add tool**.

    <kbd>![add-new-development-tool](add-new-development-tool.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

5. Select the required tool and click **Add**. This tool gets integrated with your SHIP-HATS project and a project is automatically created in the tool with the same name. For example, in this case, the SHIP-HATS project name is _Govtech-Documentation_ and hence the Jira project inherits this name.

    <kbd>![project-created-for-tools](project-created-for-tools.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

You can add build tools other than Nexus IQ and Nexus Repo in the same manner from the **Build** tab.

>**Notes:**
>- While adding tools such as WebInspect Fortify SCA under the **QA &amp; Security** tab, the system displays the quota remaining for your subscription as shown below.
><kbd>![tool-quota](tool-quota-resized-2.png ':size=100%')</kbd>
>- Once you have reached the quota, the respective tool name(s) will be disabled in the **Select Tool** drop-down list. If you still want to add these tools, please do raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/).


## [Creation of Project tool with customised project key](#creation-of-project-tool-with-customised-project-key)
