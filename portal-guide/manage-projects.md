## [Create new projects](#create-new-projects)

Subscription Admin (SA) can create new projects in SHIP-HATS and manage them. SAs assign Project Admins (PA). Both SA and PA can manage the projects by adding project tools and add users.

### To create a new project:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **Create New**.  

>**Tip:** Alternatively, if you are viewing **All Projects**, click **Create Project**.

2. Provide information in the following fields:

    - **Project Name:** Specify name of the project. 
    - **Project Description**: Specify details of the project. 
    - **Project Admin 1:** Select Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
    - **Project Admin 2:** This is an optional field. Select a second Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list. 
3. Click **Create Project**. The created project details are displayed as shown below.

SA or PA can add tools and additional PAs. 
> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.

## [View projects](#view-projects)

SA and PAs of a subscription account can view all the projects of the subscription account.

### To view a project in a subscription account:

1. From the side menu click **Projects** > **All Projects**.

    Tile view of all the projects in this subscription account is displayed. If needed, refer to Switch account

    <kbd>![](view-all-projects-tile-view.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

2. Click **Manage** to view tools that are currently added to the project.

## [Remove projects](#remove-projects)

Subscription Admin can remove a project as long as no tool has been added to it.

### To remove a project:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to [Switching account](https://docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-documentation/#/manage-account?id=switch-account).
2. Locate the project and click **Manage**. You will see ![remove-project-icon](remove-project-icon.png) beside the project name as shown below.

    <kbd>![remove-project](remove-project.png ':size=100%')</kbd>
