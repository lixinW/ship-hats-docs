# Manage Tools
This section explains how a Subscription Admin creates SHIP-HATS projects and how Project Admin manages these projects by adding the required users and tools.

- [Add project tools](#add-project-tools)
- [Create Project tool with customised project key](#creation-of-project-tool-with-customised-project-key)
- [Manage users within a Project Tool](#manage-users-within-a-project-tool)
- [Remove project tools](#remove-project-tools)


## [Add project tools](#add-project-tools)

SA or PA can add the required project tools as explained below. You can add tools for Development, Build, QA &amp; Security and Release phases as per the tools quota allotted for your subscription type. Note that currently you need to raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) for adding the following:

- Build tool - Nexus IQ and Nexus Repo
- Release and Deploy tool- Digital.ai Release and Digital.ai Deploy

> **Note:** SA and PA must have logged in to SonarQube at least once before proceeding to create applications in SonarQube.


### To add project tools:

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to Switch account.
2. Locate the project and click **Manage**.

3. Go to the required tab and click **Add tool**.
4. For example, go to **Development** tab and click **Add tool**.

    <kbd>![add-new-development-tool](add-new-development-tool.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

5. Select the required tool and click **Add**. This tool gets integrated with your SHIP-HATS project and a project is automatically created in the tool with the same name. For example, in this case, the SHIP-HATS project name is _Govtech-Documentation_ and hence the Jira project inherits this name.

    <kbd>![project-created-for-tools](project-created-for-tools.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

You can add build tools other than Nexus IQ and Nexus Repo in the same manner from the **Build** tab.

>**Notes:**
>- While adding tools such as WebInspect Fortify SCA under the **QA &amp; Security** tab, the system displays the quota remaining for your subscription as shown below.
><kbd>![tool-quota](tool-quota-resized-2.png ':size=100%')</kbd>
>- Once you have reached the quota, the respective tool name(s) will be disabled in the **Select Tool** drop-down list. If you still want to add these tools, please do raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/).
