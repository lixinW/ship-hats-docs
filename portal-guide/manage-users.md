## Manage access

### To manage access for a user

   Make sure that you are in the required account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).

   <kbd>![all-users-new](all-users-new.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

1. Click **Proceed**.  
   A confirmation message appears, indicating that the user will receive an email regarding the change. 

   >**Notes:**
   >- You will be able to update access only if the numbers of users align with the approved tools quota for the users.
   >- The Proceed button is enabled only when there is a change to the existing selection.
   >- A PA or SA user will be able to update their own access.
   >- You will not be able to proceed if both the options are cleared.



## Reactivate users

If SHIP-HATS users are inactive for 60 consecutive days, their status changes from **normal user** to **sleeping user**. If the user continues to be inactive, from day 81 onwards an email notification is sent every day to the user until user becomes active (**normal user**) or until it reaches day 90.  

On day 91, if the user is still inactive on SHIP-HATS, user status changes from **sleeping user** to **suspended user**, indicated by a grey avatar.

<!--SA and PA can reactivate a suspended user back to their account if required.-->

### To reactivate a user

If you are **a TechPass user**, the SA can raise a service request using the [TechPass Support form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5f69797d0666cb0011cc59da). It will take 1-3 business days to process the service request.

If you are **not a TechPass user**, the SA or PA can complete the following steps to reactivate a user:

1. Log in to the [SHIP-HATS portal](https://www.ship.gov.sg/).  
   Make sure that you are in the required account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).  
1.  From the side menu, click **Users > All Users**.  
1. Search for the user to be reactivated and from the **Action** column, click ![3_dot](3_dot.png) corresponding to the user.  

   <kbd>![user_status_2](user_status_2.png ':size=100%')</kbd><br />
   
   > **Tip:** Refer to [Viewing users](#view-users) to know how to search for users  

1. Choose **Reactivate User**. User, SAs and the requestor will be notified through an email about the reactivation.  

   >**Notes:**
   >- Though the reactivated user can log in using the existing credentials, we recommend reactivated users to reset their password. The email sent to the reactivated users includes the link to reset their password.  
   >- After a user has been reactivated, an email notification about this reactivation is sent to the requestor and the SAs.




## Remove users

We recommend Subscription Admin (SA) and Project Admin (PA) to periodically review the named users in their account, consumed user quota and remove users who are no longer required.

>**Note:** SA and PA can remove a user who does not have the Project Admin or Subscription Admin roles in the subscription account.

### To remove a user

>**Notes:**
>- You can remove a user that is added to the billing subscription (quota consumed) only.
>- You can remove a user from a subscription if the user is not consuming quota from the current subscription (labeled as **free user**). However, you cannot remove a user consuming quota from current subscription if the user is also included in another subscription.
>- You cannot remove a user from a billing subscription (quota consumed) if the user is also added to another subscription (quota not consumed and labeled as **free user**). 

1. Log in to the [SHIP-HATS portal](https://www.ship.gov.sg/).   
Make sure that you are in the required account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).
1. From the side menu, click **Users > All Users**.
1. Search for the user to be removed and from the **Action** column, click ![3_dot](3_dot.png) corresponding to the user.
   >**Tip:** Refer to [View users](#view-users) to know how to search for users and to sort by **Quota Consumed**.
