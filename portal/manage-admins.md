## Add project admins

Subscription Admins can add Project Admins using the SHIP-HATS portal. When creating a project in an account, it is mandatory to specify at least one Project Admin. SAs can add additional PAs anytime in the future.  

> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-getting-started/#/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.

### To add a project admin

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).
1. Locate the project, and then click three dots for more options, and then click **Manage Admins**. 
1. Click **Add New**.  
1. In the **Select Admin** drop down list, select the required user.

    >**Note:** If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
1. Click **Add** to add this user as a project admin.  
   
   After a user is successfully added, an email notification will be sent to the requesting SA with copy sent to other SA and the newly added PA.

## View existing project admins
1. Log in to [SHIP-HATS Portal](http://www.ship.gov.sg).
1. Click **Users** > **All users**.
1. Click **Project Role**.  
   Name of users will appear based on the project role.

## Change subscription admin

To change or transfer the existing SA role to another user, the SA can raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/create/364) with the required details, such as the name and email address of the user to whom the SA role is to be transferred.
