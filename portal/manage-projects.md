## Create new projects

Subscription Admin (SA) can create new projects in SHIP-HATS and manage them. SAs assign Project Admins (PA). Both SA and PA can manage the projects by adding [project tools](manage-tools), [user groups](manage-user-groups), and [users](manage-users).

### To create a new project

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **Create Project**.  

    >**Tip:** Alternatively, if you are viewing **All Projects**, click **Create Project**.  

    <!--<kbd>![Create New Project](./images/create-new-project.png ':size=100%')</kbd>-->

1. Provide information in the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |---|---|
    |**Project Name**| Specify name of the project. Your agency name is prefixed to the project name automatically. 
    |**Project Description**| Specify details of the project. 
    |**System**|Select the system from the drop-down list. 
    |**Project Admin 1**| Select Project Admin from the drop-down list. If you want to invite new users, click 
    **Invite here**. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
    |**Project Admin 2**| This is an optional field. Select a second Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list. 
1. Click **Create Project**.  
    
    The created project appears with **Subscribed Tools** and **Not Subscribed Tools** sections based on your subscription.

    SA or PA can add/create tools and additional PAs. 
    
    > **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.

## View projects

SA and PAs of a subscription account can view all the projects of the subscription account.

### To view a project in a subscription account

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects**.

    Tile view of all the projects in this subscription account appears. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).

1. Click **Manage** to view tools that are currently added to the project.

## Remove projects

Subscription Admin can remove a project if no tool has been added to it. If Tools have been added to a project, you must remove them before the project can be removed.

### To remove a project

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **All Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).
1. Locate the project, and then click three dots for more options, and then click **Delete Project**. 
    A **Delete project** pop up appears. 
1. If you are sure that you want to delete the project, click **I acknowledge that I have done all the necessary backup for the project**, and then click **Delete**.

    The project is deleted.
