## Create user groups

As an SA/PA, you can create user groups based on quota specified for your projects based on your subscription.  

### To create a user group
1. From the side menu, click **Users** > **All User Groups**. 
1. Click **Create Group**.  
   The **Create New User Group** window appears.  
   >**Note:** If you have consumed the quota available for user groups, the **Create Group** button is disabled. If you want to continue to add user groups beyond the available quota limit, create a service request.
1. Enter values in the following fields:     
   |Field|Description|
   |---|---|
   **Group Name**|Enter name for the group. Make sure that the group name meets the following criteria: <ul><li>Group name must be alphanumeric</li><li>Group name must be less than 40 characters</li><li>Group name can contain only `-` and `_` special characters</li></ul>|
   |**Group Description**|Enter description for the group. You can add up to 250 characters.|
   **Group Members**|Select users to be added to the group from the drop-down list. You can select active users in the current subscription only. Though inactive (suspended) users will also appear in the list, you cannot add them as group members.|
