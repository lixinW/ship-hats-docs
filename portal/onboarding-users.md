# Onboarding Users



This section describes the following:
- [Invite users](#invite-users)
- [Register account](#register-account)
- [Approve new users](#approve-new-users)



## Invite users
Subscription Admin (SA) and Project Admin (PA) can invite and add users to the subscription. 

> **Important:** Only SA can add a user as PA to their SHIP-HATS projects.

### To invite users

   Make sure that you are in the required account. If needed, refer to [Switch account](manage-account).

1. From the side menu, click **Users > Invite Users**.  
   
1. Click **Generate new link**. 

   By default, a new invitation link has a 14 days expiry date.  Whenever you invite new users, the same link will be displayed with the remaining expiry date until it expires. 
   
   In the example below, SA invites a new user to SHIP-HATS. As the invite was created 2 days earlier, the link is valid for the next 12 days.
