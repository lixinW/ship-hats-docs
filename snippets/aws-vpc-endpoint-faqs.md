  <summary style="font-size:20px"><b>If I am reusing DevOps and VPC endpoints that I created for SHIP-HATS 1.0, can I continue to use the endpoints?</b></summary><br>

- For tools that are being carried forward from SHIP-HATS 1.0 (e.g. Jira, Nexus, etc.), you can continue to use the same endpoints. 
- For new tools in SHIP-HATS 2.0 (SaaA GitLab), you must create and use new endpoints.</details>
