Gitlab allows groups and multi-level subgroups. The subgroups enable access control for multi-tenancy. 

The first three levels of subgroups are managed by SHIP-HATS. The first-level subgroups are the root level groups for WOG, the second-level subgroups are grouped by agency names, and the third-level subgroups are offered to our subscribers (e.g. project initiative name, department, or division name). Based on your requirement, SHIP-HATS team will create and manage these for you.   
**After the third-level groups are created, you will have the permission to create and manage any subsequent subgroups within it.**  

Gitlab subgroups have the inheritance characteristic from the parents. For more information, refer to the GitLab [groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html) and [subgroups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/) documentation.
