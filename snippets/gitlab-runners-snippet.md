To set up GitLab runners:
1. [Review the prerequisites](#prerequisites)
1. [Retrieve your runner token](#retrieve-your-runner-token)
1. [Install the runner](#install-runner)

## Prerequisites

- Access to your hosted environment/VM.
- Network connectivity for private network link setup via [AWS](aws-vpc-endpoint) or [IPsec tunnel](ipsec-tunnel).

## Retrieve your runner token

Depending on your use case, you can configure one of the following runners: 
- [**Group runner:**](#to-retrieve-group-runner-token) These runners are shared among all the projects in the group.
- [**Project runner:**](#to-retrieve-project-runner-token) These runners are specific to one project.

### To retrieve group runner token

- Navigate to your group page and access the menu as shown below:
