## Subscribing 

The following image and table outlines the steps that you must complete to get started with SHIP-HATS. After you have completed these steps, you will need to perform additional steps to onboard to the SHIP-HATS portal and configure the tools that you want to use.  

These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization and SHIP-HATS team. However, these tasks must be completed in the specified order. All steps are required unless otherwise noted.
