- **Easier to get started with DevOps:** Many lean teams can benefit from the base price that offers the GitLab integrated platforms. 
- **Flexibility:** Agencies can build your own subscription with GitLab Native and Alternative Tools based on their requirements
- **Lesser wastage:** Purchase only what you need and scale when necessary, such as when your requirements get more complex.

## Agencies with multiple Subscriptions

- If a developer is working on projects spanning across multiple SHIP-HATS subscriptions account, we recommend to assign the developer to one subscription. You can then use GitLab to allocate the user to various projects that span across multiple subscriptions.
- If you add the same user to more than one subscription through TechBiz, they will be charged more than once.  

## Upgrade 

You may upgrade to additional users and add-on anytime via the TechBiz portal.  

## Downgrade

You can downgrade only after the **Minimum Commitment Period** (Three consecutive months from the date of account provisioning).

- If you were using SHIP-HATS 1.0 and have now migrated to SHIP-HATS 2.0, your **Minimum Commitment Period** began from the date SHIP-HATS 1.0 was provisioned. 
- If you are new to SHIP-HATS and started using SHIP-HATS 2.0 directly, your **Minimum Commitment Period** begins from the date SHIP-HATS 2.0 was provisioned.
