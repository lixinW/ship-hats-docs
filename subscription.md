## Subscription Strategy

We aligned the subscription strategy with our 1.0 user observations.

- **Easier to get started with DevOps:** Many lean teams can benefit from the base price that offers the GitLab integrated platforms. 
- **Flexibility:** Agencies can build your own subscription with GitLab Native and Alternative Tools based on their requirements
- **Lesser wastage:** Purchase only what you need and scale when necessary, such as when your requirements get more complex.

## Subscription Plan

- Any SHIP-HATS subscriber starts with a [Base plan](#base-plan). 
- Based on needs subscribers, you can optionally choose any [Add-ons](#add-ons).
- For all new subscriptions, there will be a **Minimum Commitment Period of six months** from the date of SHIP-HATS account provisioning. 


### Base plan



- 3 x GitLab Ultimate User License 
  - Got more users? You can buy up to  47 additional GitLab Ultimate license as [Add-on](#add-ons). If you have more than 50 users (3 Base + 47 Add-ons), you will need to purchase additional Base plan. 
  - One subscriber can have more than one Base plan
  - Fair Usage Policy – 1 GitLab license is entitled to up to 10 GB
- Standard support (8:30 AM to 5 PM)
- pCloudy shared

## Agencies with multiple Subscriptions

- If a developer is working on projects spanning across multiple SHIP-HATS subscriptions account, we recommend to assign the developer to one subscription. You can then use GitLab to allocate the user to various projects that span across multiple subscriptions.
- If you add the same user to more than one subscription through TechBiz, they will be charged more than once.
