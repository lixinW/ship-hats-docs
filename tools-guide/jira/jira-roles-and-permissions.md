### Jira user groups

Groups are an easier and efficient way to manage user access for multiple users. Users can raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) with the required group name and user details such as name and email address. Crowd administrator from the SHIP-HATS team then evaluates the request and approves it accordingly.


If approved, the group is created with the agency name prefixed to it. For example, *govtech-codex-documentation*. If a group is already created for managing users in any one of the Atlassian products added to your project on SHIP-HATS, you will be able to see that in all the integrated Atlassian products. Note that user groups are created at a global level and are visible to all SHIP-HATS users. Jira project administrators can manage user groups for the project.

### Jira custom permissions

Administrator can raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) to change project permissions for an existing user role.

### Jira custom-roles

Although we highly encourage you to use Jira project roles, if it is critical for your project to have custom project roles, the Administrator can raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) to the Jira administrator in the SHIP-HATS team.

Jira administrator from the SHIP-HATS team evaluates the requests on a case-by-case basis. Note that such custom project roles are created at a global level and they are visible to all SHIP-HATS users.
