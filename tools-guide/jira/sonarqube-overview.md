# SonarQube

SonarQube is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smell. We support two versions of SonarQube:
- Sonarqube Community Edition
- Sonarqube Developer Edition

By default, SonarQube Community edition is available with all the tier subscription (except for Starter tier). 

If you need the Developer edition, you must buy the [add-on of additional languages](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription.html).  With the additional languages add-on purchased, as the Subscription Administrator (SA) or Project Administrator (PA), you will have the flexibility to create SonarQube applications from both the Community and Developer editions. SA and PA must have logged in to SonarQube at least once before proceeding to create applications in SonarQube. Though only SA and PA can create applications in SonarQube, we recommend all users to log in to SonarQube at least once to ease the process if a user role is changed to a PA role in the future.

|**Subscription Package**|**Add-ons**|**SonarQube Instance**|
|---|---|---|  
|Starter|None|None|
|Starter|Basic languages|Community|
|Starter|Basic languages + Additional languages|Developer + Community|
|All other Packages except Starter|None|Community|
|All other Packages except Starter|Additional languages|Developer + Community|

As an SA, after you have bought the Additional languages add-on, you cannot remove the add-on if your subscription still has SonarQube applications in the Developer edition. You will need to remove all the SonarQube applications in the Developer edition before you can downgrade and remove the add-on.
