- Place hosted repositories higher in the list than proxy repositories within the list. For proxy repositories, the repository manager needs to periodically check remote for updates, which will incur more overhead than a hosted repository lookup.  
- Place repositories with a higher probability of matching the majority of components higher in this list. If most of your components will be retrieved from the Central Repository, putting Central higher in this list than a smaller, more focused repository will improve the performance because the repository manager will not search the smaller remote repository for as many missing components.
