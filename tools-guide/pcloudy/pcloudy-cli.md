## pCloudy CLI

pCloudy CLI is a Command Line Interface(CLI) tool to be used as part of the Bamboo pipeline to help book and release devices on pCloudy.

## Prerequisites
- The user must be a Project Admin (PA) in order to retrieve the pCloudy token from the SHIP-HATS Self Help Portal.
- Make sure that your bamboo plan has an elastic image configuration of the HATS security agent dedicated to it (check with the HATS team)

## Retrieve PCloudy Token

To use the pCloudy CLI in bamboo, you would need to retrieve your pCloudy token from your pCloudy application from the SHIP-HATS Self Help portal.

### To retrieve PCloudy token

1. Log in to the [SHIP-HATS Portal](https://www.ship.gov.sg).
1. Click **Projects** > **All Projects**, and then click **Manage** on the project that your pCloudy application is in. If your pCloudy application is already created, you can jump to step 5. If you want to create a new pCloudy application, go to next step.

## Set up Bamboo Plan

### To set up your Bamboo plan
After you have your pCloudy token, you can use the pCloudy CLI in your bamboo plans, to book and release devices on pCloudy.

You can also use the pCloudy CLI to upload files to pCloudy.

## Upload Files

This is an optional step. This is mainly used to upload your application to pCloudy for testing.


### To upload files

You can use the pCloudy CLI with the command: `pcloudy-cli upload-file`. 

- You need your token for this command
- The name of the uploaded file may be different from the original name of the file
- The file cannot be empty
- The file can only have the extensions of `.zip` , `.apk`, or `.ipa`. 
- The name of the file may only contain the alphanumeric characters and ( `-` , `_` , `.` ) characters
- The required options are:
    - --pcloudy-token, -P
    - --file, -f

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Command Format**

```
pcloudy-cli upload-file -P <your pCloudy Token> -f <Path to file to upload>
``` 
 
**Example: Upload a test build of an Android application to pCloudy**
```
pcloudy-cli upload-file -P "$token" -f artifacts/test_build_12_21.apk
```

### **Output Format**

If successful, the command would exit successfully with a stdout of:

```
{"uploaded_filename": "STRING"}
```

**Example pcloudy-cli upload-file -P "$token" -f artifacts/test_build_12_21.apk**
```
>> {"uploaded_filename": "test_build_12_21-1637507508.apk"}
```

You can then use a tool like `jq`  or `awk`  or `grep`  to get the data you want out of the stdout.

<!-- tabs:end -->




## Book Device

Regardless of whether you upload your test file or not to pCloudy, you can use the pCloudy CLI to book a device for testing.

### To book a device

- You need your token for this command
- This command will return you the `rid` (used for releasing the booked device early) and the `api_endpoint` (the appium endpoint you would use to run your robots tests)
- You can choose between browser testing or application testing  
- The required options are:
    - --pcloudy-token, -P
    - --duration, -d
    - --platform, -p
- Ensure that at least one of these options are used to set the test type of the booked device:
    - --app-name, -a
    - --browser, -b
- Optional options:
    - --platform-version
    - --device-name

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Browser Testing**

**Command Format** 
```
pcloudy-cli book-device \
    -P <your pCloudy Token> \
    -d <duration to book the device (minutes)> \
    -p <device platform, [ios,android]> \
    -b # -b for browser based tests
```
**Android Example: Book Android device for browser testing, 10 minutes**
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 10 -p android -b
```

**iOS Example: Book iOS device for browser testing, 10 minutes**
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 10 -p ios -b
```

### **App Testing**

**Command Format**
```
pcloudy-cli book-device \
    -P <your pCloudy Token> \
    -d <duration to book the device (minutes)> \
    -p <device platform, [ios,android]> \
    -a <filename of app to test> # -a for app based tests
```    
**Android Example: Book Android device for app testing, 20 minutes**  

Ensure the package file to be in the current directory
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 20 -p android -a "demo_app.apk"
```
**iOS Example: Book iOS device for app testing, 20 minutes**  

Ensure the package file to be in the current directory
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 20 -p ios -a "demo_app.ipa"
```
### **Additional (Optional) Parameters**

**Book specific device based on platform version: Book specific iOS device with platform version 14.1.0**  

```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 20 -p ios -b --platform-version "14.1.0"
```

**Book specific device based on device full name**
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P "$token" -d 20 -p ios -b --full-name "Apple_iPhoneXR_Ios_14.4.0_f1c43"
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Expected Outputs

If the command ran successfully, you should get a stdout of:

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Output Format**

```
{"rid": "INTEGER", "api_endpoint": "STRING, Appium Endpoint", ...other device information}
``` 
 
**Example**
```
pcloudy-cli book-device -P 6ba4b6d2f0fecc6f2b9ee16bee2d2eb8 -d 10 -p ios -b
>> {"duration": 10, "platform": "ios", "full_name": "Apple_iPhoneXR_Ios_14.4.0_f1c43", "version": "14.4.0", "rid": "52485", "platform_name": "Ios", "browser_name": "14", "device_name": "14", "appium_endpoint": "https://hats.pcloudy.com/appium/hubble/n6nn6382nbnf-6643"}
```

You can then use a tool like jq  or awk  or grep  to get the data you want out of the stdout.


<!-- tabs:end -->




## Run your tests

After booking the device (and optionally uploading your apk file), you can run additional commands to perform your pCloudy tests. In this example, we are using Robot Framework as the testing framework.

### To run your tests

**Sample Test Script**  

In this test script, we are running mobile browser testing.
This script is saved into a test file named `test.txt`.

Note that the sample APK file is already uploaded with the name of `pCloudyAppiumDemo.apk`.

- If you upload a package file with the same filename, the filename will be appended with a random numerical identifier by default - e.g, ` pCloudyAppiumDemo-1638321800.apk`.
- Value of the APP_PACKAGE use `com.pcloudy.appiumdemo`.

## Download Test Logs
After your tests are complete you can also download the logs from pCloudy using the pcloudy-cli download-logs-data command. This is an optional step.

### To download test logs
- You will need your pCloudy Token and `rid`  used to book the device
- The logs will also be based on the tests ran on the booked device
- Log files will be downloaded into the bamboo agent, where you can persist them by saving them as bamboo artifacts.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Command Format**

```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P <your pCloudy Token> -r <rid string when the device was booked>
``` 
 
**Example: Download the logs of tests ran on booked device with rid of 52485**
```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P "$token" -r 52485
```

### **Output Format**

If successfuly, the command would exit successfully with a stdout of:

```
{"success_logs": ["STRING", ...], "failed_logs": ["STRING", ...]}
```

**Example**
```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P "$token" -r 52485
>> {"success_logs": [".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/cpu.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/mem.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/net.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/bat.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/appium_stdout.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/appium_stderr.txt"], "failed_logs: [".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/log.txt"]}
```

### **Directory Structure Format**

The downloaded logs will be stored in the current project's directory , in the bamboo agent, with a format of:  

```
./.pcloudy_appium_logs
|-- rid (NUMBER)
