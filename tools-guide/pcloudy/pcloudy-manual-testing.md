# Manual Testing


## Prerequisites
To access the [pCloudy web dashboard](https://hats.pcloudy.com), make sure you have the following:
- SHIP VPN
- Internet access and Firefox browser/ Firefox Developer Edition browser, preferably on a non-government issued laptop/ development laptop
- The required proxy configuration will be provided during on-boarding.

As the dashboard can only be accessed via the proxy:
- We strongly recommend the use of Firefox browser as it is tied to browser-level settings. If Chrome is used, it will affect the system-level settings.
- Please note that only pCloudy site will be accessible, all other Internet sites are blocked. Unauthorized access to other websites are being monitored and logged.
