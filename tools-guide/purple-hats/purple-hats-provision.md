### To provision Purple Hats, you need to onboarding and dedicating HATS Linux Elastic Agent

- If you have onboarded SHIP-HATS previously, you would have a dedicated Linux elastic agent to perform the security scans with Fortify and/or SonarQube. You can use the same Linux agent for Purple HATS scan as well.

- If you are new, please raise a [HATS service request](https://go.gov.sg/hats-ssd) to request for dedication of elastic agent. Include information on Bamboo build project/build plan for your project.
