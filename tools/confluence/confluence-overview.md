## Provision Confluence via SHIP-HATS Portal


## Roles and Permissions

You can use Confluence for efficient project collaboration and knowledge sharing among your team. It also enables you to manage your project documentation. [SHIP-HATS Project Admin (PA)](user-roles-permissions) can add Atlassian Confluence to the SHIP-HATS project. 
 
Confluence user roles and permissions
Once you add Confluence as your project tool, a space is created. Please refer to [Confluence Space Permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/space-permissions-overview-139521.html) to know more about the possible permissions for users added to the space.

### SHIP-HATS - Confluence role mapping

| SHIP-HATS Users | Confluence Users |
| :------- | ----------- |
| Project Admin | Administrator for the space.</br>When Confluence is added to a SHIP-HATS project, by default the Project Admin is set as the Administrator for a space. Administrator can add other users to this space and manage their permissions. There can be more than one space administrator. |
| Users | SHIP-HATS users can be assigned as an administrator or added as user to the space. |

### Confluence Users 

You can add and manage users as Group and Individual Users. 

### Confluence Groups 

Groups are an easier and efficient way to manage user access for multiple users. Users can raise a [service request](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/) with the required group name, project name and user details such as name and email address. Crowd administrator in the SHIP-HATS team evaluates the request and approves it accordingly.  

If approved, the group is created with the agency name prefixed to it. For example, *govtech-codex-documentation*. If a group was already created for managing users in any one of the Atlassian products added to your project on SHIP-HATS, you would be able to see that in all the integrated Atlassian products. Note that user groups are created at a global level and are visible to all SHIP-HATS users. Space administrators can manage user groups for the space.

### Confluence Individual Users

Administrator can add users individually and manage their permissions for a space.

Please refer to [Confluence Space Permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/space-permissions-overview-139521.html) to know more about the possible permissions for the users added to a space.
