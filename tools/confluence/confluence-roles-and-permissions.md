# Roles and Permissions

You can use Confluence for efficient project collaboration and knowledge sharing among your team. It also enables you to manage your project documentation. [SHIP-HATS Project Admin (PA)](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-portal/user-roles-and-permissions) can add Atlassian Confluence to the SHIP-HATS project. 
 
## Confluence user roles and permissions

After you add Confluence as your project tool, a space is created. [Learn about Confluence Cloud permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/learn-about-confluence-cloud-permissions/) to know more about the possible permissions for users added to the space.
