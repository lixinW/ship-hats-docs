# Fortify On Demand

Fortify On Demand delivers application security as a service, providing you with the security testing, vulnerability management, expertise, and support needed to easily create, supplement, and expand a Software Security Assurance program.

In FOD, both SAST and DAST are integrated. The same users provisioned to do SAST will also be able to do DAST in the FOD portal. We have also provided some Gitlab templates which users can use to complete their scans. For more information, refer to following topics:
- [DAST Scan](fod/fod-dast-scan)
- [SAST Scan](fod/fod-sast-scan)
