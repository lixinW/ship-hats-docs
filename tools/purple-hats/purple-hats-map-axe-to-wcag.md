# Map AXE to WCAG

Purple HATS is currently using AXE 3.5
- We will be updating to use AXE 4.x which covers 2 more clauses
- Refer to AXE rules and remediation Advice here

Purple HATS also covers the following WCAG clauses while not included in the accessibility checks:

- [WCAG 2.2.4 Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-link.html)
- [WCAG 2.4.9 Interruptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html)
- [WCAG 3.2.5 Change on Request](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-no-extreme-changes-context.html)

### WCAG2.1 success criteria from W3C, consists of Level AA except clause 1.2
