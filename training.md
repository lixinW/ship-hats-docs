# Overview


We are rolling out trainings for Developers and Project Managers to help them learn and leverage the features for SHIP-HATS 2.0 to practice DevSecOps best practices.



## Scope  

The training that GovTech builds is specific to SHIP-HATS and how to leverage the templates that we offer. We encourage the Agencies and Vendors to leverage on standard trainings to understand the base concepts related to DevSecOps and CI/CD to maximise the learnings from SHIP-HATS trainings.


## Format

We are rolling out **Learning Events** (Webinars and Workshops) and building **Self-Paced** (Videos and Documentation) modules  for developers and project managers.


## Audience
The trainings are curated for technical (developers, software engineers etc.) and non-technical (project managers, business analysts).
