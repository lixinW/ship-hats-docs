# Overview
This Web App Tutorial is a hands-on tutorial that provides an introduction to the use of templates and compliance developed by SHIP-HATS.

Goal of this tutorial is to provide a Hands on experience of using an End-to-End (e2e) SHIP-HATS templates and understanding the design rationale of these templates.


## Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have the following:
    - Onboarded to SHIP-HATS
    - Deployment target
    - Development background
    - Basic understanding of DevOps and CI/CD


- Raise a request at [go.gov.sg/she](go.gov.sg/she ) to get the following information:

    - Trainee number `#`
    - TP User account 
    - Nexus Repo test account
    - Nexus IQ test account
    - FOD DAST/SAST test account

### Out of scope

- Debugging of your pipelines
- Explaining DevOps
- Coding 101

## How to use this tutorial

The tutorial contains of a list of [checkpoints](checkpoints) to guide you to build and deploy a simple Python web application while adhering to the DevSecOps practices and being as compliant as possible.

- In each checkpoint, you will complete some step-by-step development work that will help the you learn to use the templates and their design rationale.  
- Branches numbered in sequence have been provided in this repository. These branches contain the code that should be used at each checkpoint.  
- You can also use them (`what does them mean here`) to skip ahead by merging the relevant checkpoint to their branches. For example, for skipping to checkpoint 4, you can run `git merge` for checkpoint 4.
