## Extended Code Analysis (XCA)

In line with the CSG advisory sent earlier, [Extended Code Analysis (XCA)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/cybersecurity/xca/overview.html) has been integrated with SHIP-HATS 2.0â€™s GitLab Dedicated Platform.  XCA is an augmented security testing tool that help users detect source code vulnerabilities that are common across the government.

From 10 Mar 2023, XCA will be enabled by default on all pipelines. Since XCA is added as a required pipeline configuration in SHIP-HATS 2.0 GitLab, no configuration action is required from tenants (refer to [SHIP-HATS documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-getting-started/ship-hats-tools) for more details). To review the XCA findings, refer to the Vulnerability Report (**GitLab** > **Security & Compliance** > **Vulnerability Report**) in GitLab.
